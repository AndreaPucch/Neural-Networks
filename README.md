# Installation
I have used Google Colab to write the notebook, therefore the installation only requires one step: 

Opening the .ipyn in Colab and it's ready to go!

It is possible to perform 3 different training tests, already provided in the notebook under the section **Tests/Training process**.
To configure all the variables and perform all the imports, it is sufficient to execute all the cells above **Tests** section.
After running the tests, some statistics such as loss and accuracy are plotted for a visual representation of the results.
